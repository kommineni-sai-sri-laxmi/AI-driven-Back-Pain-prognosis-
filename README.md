# AI-driven-Back-Pain-prognosis-
Successfully developed a real-time prediction tool for assessing the risk of low back pain (LBP) among IT professionals, a group particularly vulnerable to LBP due to prolonged sedentary work. By using a U-Net model for semantic segmentation, the application identifies and analyses key biomechanical parameters pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence, and sacral slope  to assess each user’s LBP risk level. The application’s interactive, user-friendly interface built with Stream lit ensures that users can easily upload images, view segmented regions, and receive actionable feedback. This tool not only helps users understand their individual risk levels but also promotes awareness of ergonomic practices that could improve their spinal health and overall well-being.
